## What is the `Note Protocol`?

The Note Protocol is the first smart contract solution on Bitcoin. Without making any changes to Bitcoin, it introduces a new era of smart contracts on Bitcoin by combining on-chain asset confirmation and off-chain contract runtime. The protocol uses Bitcoin's native scripting functionality (bytecode Opcodes), an off-chain indexer, the sCrypt high-level programming language, and the BVM virtual machine. It was developed by the team led by Lilong. On February 14, 2024, the first asset token of the protocol, NOTE, was issued, with a total supply of 21 million. The protocol combines fixed bitwork (mining difficulty) with contract logic to control the halving mechanism of mining output in a fair and public manner.
